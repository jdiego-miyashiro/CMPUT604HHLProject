# CMPUT604 HHL Project
This is a repository for my final project for Introduction to Quantum Computing at UofA.

CMPUT 604 was a Introduction to Quatum Computing class at the University of Alberta that had for a final project a full implementation for a Quatum Algorithm
I decided to go for a toy example of the HHL for a particular family of matrices with equal diagonal entries, however when I first wrote the code I didn't anticipate 
having to share it  so I just hard code my IBM API token and some other test cases that I used to write the report this is why currently I'am just going to share the PDF 
where Ishow the circuits I composed and the results while I make the code ready so that everyone can use it inputing their own token and specifications for the matrix
to be solved in the IBM Quatum Computers
